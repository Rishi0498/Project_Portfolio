Applied K-means Clustering and PCA to Celestrak TLE orbital data to identify Non-Starlink Satellites with similar orbital parameters to Starlink Satellites and utilized SGP4 algorithm to determine a ratio of potential conjunction of Starlink with non-Starlink satellite.

The .R file contains the entire code for orbital predictions including the SGP4 algorithm. The txt file has the satellite orbit data. Download both the files into same folder and then execute the R code.
